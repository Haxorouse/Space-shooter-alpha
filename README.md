# Space-shooter-alpha
This is a project I started in school, Some of the code is to be credited to my teacher Gregory Loomis but most of this code is my own original work
all due credit will be given in the yet to be made credits
I plan to continue development of this game for the forseeable future aand add more featrures and better code as my skills increase
much of this code is almoast 2 years old and made when I was very new to programing so it is terribly written
I do not plan to imporve the horrible existing code because it works
I appologise for the lack of comments but most of should be readable enough, I do plan to add comments in the future but Im lazy to do it now
